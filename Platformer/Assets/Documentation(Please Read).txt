	The level loading script is complete, and should be robust enough to carry the project without being changes in any way.
Should this not be true, I did not comment the code at all. So good luck editing the code that I forgot what it did WHILE I
was writing it. 
	As of the writing of this, all that need to be done to transition scenes as the player, in a new scene, is that the 
LevelLoader needs do be given a reference to the player and the animator of the SceneTransition object(which is also in the 
SceneTransition folder, and the Doors need to be given the name of the scene to transition to.
	Every thing else is already handled dynamically, so while the game is runnging. I did it like this so that it would be 
easy for me to add new levels, turn out I did it so you didn't have to read my god awful code.
Please make this project a real game, I wanted to see it to completion, but that just isn't possible right now.
